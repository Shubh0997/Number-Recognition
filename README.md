# Number-Recognition
This jupyter-notebook implements nerual network models(Aritificial and Convolutional Nerual Network) to classify hand written number digits.
The data is MNIST dataset.
Library used for creating the model is 'keras' using tensorflow backend.

The error in classification using Simple aritificial Nerual Network is 1.8%

The error in classification using Convolutional Neural Network is 1.2%

Convolutional Neural Network does better job in classifying the digits.
